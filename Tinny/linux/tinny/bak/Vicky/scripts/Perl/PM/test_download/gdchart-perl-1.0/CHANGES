Added up to 10 stacked graphs.  Hopefully, this will satisfy almost all.

New stack type for double_stack and triple_stack graphs, "layered".  

A Makemaker guy came through!  Run "perl Makefile.PL" for auto build ... 
thanks to Keith Grandin.  Known to work on both Solaris and Linux.  Let me
know if you have problems.

New pie chart options which work correctly and new docs to describe them.  See
Pie Chart docs.

Added GDC_extcolor, which allows color to be set for all plot points.  See 
Standard Options.

Added GDC_bg_image, which allows you to use a GIF as a background image for
your graph.  See Standard Options.

Added annotations.  See Standard Options.
