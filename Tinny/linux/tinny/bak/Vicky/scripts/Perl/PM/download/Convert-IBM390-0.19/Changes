Revision history for Perl extension Convert::IBM390.

0.01  Tue Jan 12 12:36:20 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- Geoffrey Rommel (grommel@sears.com)

0.02  Mon Apr 12 13:11:16 1999
	- made compatible with 5.004 and earlier releases
	- Original version had a bug when char was unsigned, but it
	  was not revealed by 'make test'.  Squished the bug; smoothed
	  out the signed/unsigned business; added test for the buggy
	  condition.

0.03  Wed Jun  9 14:34:17 1999
	- Added unpackeb(), ":all" tag.
	- Eliminated the superfluous IBM390lib subdirectory.
	- Smoothed out the signed/unsigned business some more.
	- Corrected the package name in IBM390.xs.

0.04  Wed Jun 23 08:11:54 1999
	- Made $warninv global.
	- Further (final?) signed/unsigned improvements.
	- Added validity checking and 'x' option to unpackeb.
	- Added debugging option.

0.05  Tue Jul 20 14:43:17 1999
	- Transitional release.
	- pdi and pdo renamed to packed2num and num2packed.
	- Added zoned2num and num2zoned functions.
	- Added packeb function.
	- Added zoned support to unpackeb.

0.06  Wed Jul 28 07:45:05 1999
	- Removed separate functions for packed and zoned conversions.
	- Removed $warninv.
	- Diverged from IBM390p.

0.07  Tue Sep  7 13:16:47 1999
	- Merged Perl and Perl/XS versions into one distribution
	  with identical functions.
	- Added packeb() and unpackeb() to Perl-only version.

0.08  Tue Sep  7 13:16:47 1999
	- Added a dummy IBM390.pm to the top directory so that CPAN
	  could find it.  It includes the POD for the use of
	  search.cpan.org.

0.10  Tue Oct 17 10:29:35 2000
	- Changed 'sv_undef' to 'PL_sv_undef' to conform with current
	  perl5 lingo.  Otherwise identical to 0.09.

0.11  Fri Dec 15 12:45:21 2000
	- Added "#include <stdio.h>" to IBM390lib.ccc (don't know how
	  I missed that one!).
	- Small cosmetic changes.

0.12  Mon Jan 15 08:51:47 2001
	- Redesigned XS version to correct a bad memory leak.  Thanks
	  to Barry Roomberg and another user for pointing this out
	  and providing test code.  Unfortunately, I had to put a
	  limit on the number of values returned by unpackeb, but
	  it's fairly generous (4400).
	- New e-mail address for yours truly.

0.14  Mon Mar 12 14:41:31 2001
	- Modified Makefile.PL to see whether Perl is using sv_undef
	  or PL_sv_undef and adjust things automatically.
	- Small cosmetic changes.

0.15  Tue Apr  9 14:20:12 2002
	- Corrected bug in asc2eb, eb2asc, and eb2ascp when translating
	  empty strings.
	- Added 'P' option to packeb (suggested by a requirement from
	  Tony Maa).
	- Added version function.

0.16  Tue Nov 18 08:44:02 2003
	- Rewritten to pull the packeb.c code into the XS routine.
	- Used "unsigned long" rather than "long long" to correct a
	  bug when building under Windows.
	- Math library (-lm) is no longer required.

0.17  Wed Dec 24 09:19:59 2003
	- Added the SMF timestamp data type at the request of Champ
	  Lee.

0.18  Mon Mar 15 14:02:30 2004
	- Made performance improvements to the XS/C version: moved the
	  translation tables into the C code, moved asc2eb etc. to
	  the .xs file rather than .pm, avoided storage allocations.
	- Added trailing blank/null suppression to unpackeb('E'...).
	- Thanks are due to Jeffrey Horner for these suggestions.

0.19  Wed Jul 14 16:39:54 2004
	- Corrected a bug in unpackeb's integer conversions. Thanks
	  to Taavo Raykoff for pointing this out.
