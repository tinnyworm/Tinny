This new version (2.5) of Statistics::Descriptive contains:

- frequency_distribution was modified so that specific bins could be
  defined.  Also, caching was fixed so that it works.

- Lots of changes to the test suite to enhance coverage.

- Caching was removed from least_squares_fit since it didn't make
  sense.

- Added user survey to distribution.
