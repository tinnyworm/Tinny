	* lib/Date/Simple.pm ($VERSION): Version 2.04.

	* lib/Date/Simple.pm (use overload): Overload more operators: ==
	!= eq ne
	(_inval): Stylistic changes.
	(_new): New sub, built from the old 'new'.  Accept YYYYMMDD
	strings without hyphens.  Return undef rather than dying on
	unrecognized format.  ('new' still dies for compatibility.)
	(date): Use '_new'.  Avoid use of 'eval' and $@.
	(new): Use '_new'.
	(pod): Update docs.

	* lib/Date/Simple/NoXS.pm (_eq): New sub.
	(_ne): New sub.

	* Simple.xs (is_object): New function.
	(new_for_cmp): New function.
	(_add): Use is_object().
	(_subtract): Use is_object().
	(_compare): Use is_object() and new_for_cmp().
	(_eq): New sub.
	(_ne): New sub.

	* t/date.t: Test new equality operators.

	* README: Regenerated from lib/Date/Simple.pm.

	* t/date.t: Test today() fix.

	* Version 2.00.

	* Added functional interface (date, d8, ymd).

	* Reduced dependence on time_t, most functions work for dates up
	to 9999.
