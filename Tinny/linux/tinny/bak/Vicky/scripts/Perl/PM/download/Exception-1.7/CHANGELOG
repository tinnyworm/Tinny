Change log for Extension.pm

2003/06/22 1.7 pete@skydancer.org.uk
Minor fix for mod_perl.

2002/09/09 1.6 pete@skydancer.org.uk
Trivial changes.

2002/03/08 1.5 pete@skydancer.org.uk
The text method is now split into a replacement text method that only
returns the text as an arrayref and allows the text to be set as well as
read, and a new stringify method that returns the text as a single string.

The old text method tried to do too much and the new arrangement allows,
say, an HTML error subclass to only need to replace the stringify method
with one that generates HTML.

2001/04/05 1.4 pete@skydancer.org.uk
First released version, derived from Horus::Error.
