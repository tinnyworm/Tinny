This is the template for Dave's continuity simulation. The example here for
switching from US Credit FFM V10.0 to FP V3.0

/work/ffp6/FP_US_Credit_3.0/FP_3.0_upgrade_from_FFM_10.0

Dave's continuity simulation exams the case multiplier for a fixed week with
the switching date changes, in order to eliminate the effect of data
difference. 

There are 4 dirs under the root directory

switch_model: contains all the switch models
eval: evaluation directory
data: data
select: select files
bin: tools
extract: final results

                                                                     |
                                                                SWITCH_DATE
******* : the week for score distribution
v       : switch dates

switch_model:
1. copy the old model to old/ and the new model to new/
2. copy all the model rule files from old/ and new/ to switch_model
3. add "new" and "old" to the INCLUDE in the model rule files accordingly
4. make switch.cnf template
	1. add one more MODEL_SET line
	2. change TEMPLATE_FILE to
		TEMPLATE_FILE = switch.tmplt
	3. change RULE_BASE_FILE to 
		RULE_BASE_FILE = switch-__SWITCH_DATE__.rul
5. make switch.rul template
	IF (TRAN.TRAN_DATE < "__SWITCH_DATE__") THEN /* old model */
   BEGIN
		/* old model rule */
	END;
	ELSE
	BEGIN
		/* new model rule */
	END;

	note: sometime you may need to add or change the variable definitions
6. modify Makefile
	1. switch date (DATE)
	2. week range (RANGE)
7. That's all!

eval:

extract:
1. modify Makefile
	1. RANGE
	2. WEEKS
2. run make
3. run ../bin/getCases.pl
4. put .csv in EXCEL

DONE!
