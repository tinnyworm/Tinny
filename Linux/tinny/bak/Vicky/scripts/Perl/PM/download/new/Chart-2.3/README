2.2 - 2.3  Changes done by Christine Zilker:
        Added new Options: 
	     in Composite: 
                legend_example_height    changes thickness of the lines in the legend,
	        f_y_tick1, f_y_tick2 analog to f_y_tick 
                                         used for right and left y-axes
	     in Direction: 
                pairs                    

        Added the possibility to add more datasets in Chart::Direction 
			   
	Fixed "label space" problem in Pie
	Fixed dataset order (in the legend) in StackedBars
	Fixed problem of getting the right values if round2Tick is used
	Fixed problem of datavalues in _find_y_scale
	Some minor bugfixes	    

        Update of the Documentation (Documentation.pdf)

        The requested support of TruType fonts was currently dropped due to
        missing support in GD.pm (even in new versions)
        
        The print out of some hints and warnings where deleted not to confuse
        the user.

2.1 - 2.2: Composite.pm: imagemap_dump() repaired.

1.1 - 2.1: Changes done by Markus Brandl:
	new Modules added: ErrorBars.pm, HorizontalBars.pm, Pareto.pm,                          
	 
	Pie.pm, Split.pm and Direction.pm

        Subdirectory "doc" contains a Acrobat Reader Documentation.pdf file.

	Function add_datafile() added. It is now possible to add a complete
	datafile.

        Added new Options: precision, xy_plot, min_x_ticks, max_x_ticks,
	skip_y_ticks, skip_int_ticks, legend_label_value, y_axes,
	scale, interval, start, interval_ticks, sort, same_error, point,
	line, arrow, angle_interval, min_circles, max_circles
	Also added: the 'title' and 'x_label' options in the colors option 

	Documentation (Documentation.pdf) added.

	_find_x_scale, _find_x_range and _draw_x_number_ticks added to make 
	xy_plots possible.

	_sort_data has now a body. 

        Fixed integer ticks problem by adding the skip_int_ticks option
	Fixed f_x_ticks and f_y_ticks problem in Composite
	Fixed negative value problem in Bars
	Fixed min_val and max_val problem in draw_data function of all modules:
	Now, Chart plots the data only if the data is in the area of min_val and
	max_val! The border of bars in Bars, HorizontalBars and StackedBars will
	be plotted pink (not misccolor) if the data isn't in the min_val-max_val
	interval.
	Fixed custom_x_ticks problem in _draw_x_ticks
	Some other bugfixes.
	Updates in _find_y_scale, _round2tick, _calcTickInterval 
	   

1.0.1 - 1.1: Changes done by David Pottage:
        Plot scales can now have any magnitude. 
        It does not matter if the data covers a range of 100000000000 units
        or 0.00000000001 units, the scale will be correctly calculated.

        Ticks on plot scales are now plotted on 'round' numbers. 
        The number & spacing of ticks is chosen based on the data range.

        False zero graphs are now explicitly supported, and will be 
        generated if the data range merits it. 
        The instance field 'include_zero' should be set to zero to suppress this.

        Added: include_zero, min_y_ticks, max_y_ticks, integer_ticks_only
