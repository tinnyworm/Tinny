For information on installing Date::Manip, see the INSTALL file included in
the distribution.  For other documentation, see the Manip.pod file.

Please send questions or bug reports to me rather than posting them to
a newsgroup since I may miss them there, BUT read the next paragraph
before you automatically start firing off email to me!

If you have questions about Date::Manip, refer to the Date::Manip pod file.
Don't know what I'm talking about?  Read the perlpod man page.  Alternately,
an online version of the Date::Manip man page is included in my home page
given below.  PLEASE read the man page thoroughly before posting any questions
about Date::Manip to a newsgroup or emailing me.  If you've done this, I'll be
glad to answer any questions not covered or unclear in the man page.


** IMPORTANT NOTE (5.35) **

I am considering going OO... so everyone should use the appropriate
functions (UnixDate, Date_Cmp, Delta_Format) to extract information
from dates and deltas.  Any script which parses a date or delta as
a string will stop working when/if I make this change.  Even if I
don't, the internal format for both will change, so the above routines
should be used.


Notes for version 5.40:
   Bug fix release.  No significant new functionality.

  If you would like to stay informed about future versions of this module,
  and especially if you are interested in beta testing future versions,
  please let me know by email at:
    sbeck@cpan.org

  The newest version (which should be considered a beta version) is available
  through my home page:
    http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sbeck/
  Feel free to try it out.

  The current (non-beta) version of this module is available from you nearest
  CPAN site and is NOT available from my home page.  I will announce new
  (non-beta) releases in comp.lang.perl.misc and comp.lang.perl.announce.

All documentation is now contained in the Manip.pod file so I don't have
to keep it up-to-date in two places.
