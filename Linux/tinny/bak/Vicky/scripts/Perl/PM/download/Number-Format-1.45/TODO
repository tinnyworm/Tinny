Planned improvements for Number::Format
---------------------------------------

    I'd like very much to have a function to format a
    number eventually inserting leading zeroes in front of it. For istance:
    format_picture(100.023, '##,###.##')     yields   '000100.02'
    format_picture(1000.023, '##,###.##')   yields   '01,000.02'
    [wrw] How about: '0#,###.##' yields '01,000.02' but '##,###.##'
	  yields ' 1,000.02'?

    Merge Number::Format and Text::Number

    Emulate a complete ORACLE, SYBASE and COBOL-like picture-based
    formatting service for numbers and dates. I realise this is
    probably asking for the nile right now, however .... so anyway
    I'll look around for any c-code based stuff, but my thoughts are a
    regexp-type solution at this point.
