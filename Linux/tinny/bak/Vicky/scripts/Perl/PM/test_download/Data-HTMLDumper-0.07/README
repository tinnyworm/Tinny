Data/HTMLDumper version 0.01
============================

This is like Data::Dumper, but makes html tables instead of pretty
printing with whitespace.  It can be used in any Perl that is generating
output destined for a browser.

Starting with version 0.04 regex substitutions were replaced with a
Parse::RecDescent scheme.  The main difference for casual users is that
the tables produced look different in many cases.  They are actually more
consistent.  So I think they are better.
