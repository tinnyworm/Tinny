Revision history for Perl extension Data::HTMLDumper.

0.07  Thu Oct  7 14:42 Central African Time 2004
        - Corrected the grammar so that hash keys can be any valid string.
          Previously, they had been limited to identifier names, that was
          clearly wrong.

        - Introduced an OO callback scheme so users can control the output.
          Default output is now produced via HTMLDumper::Ouput.  By
          subclassing it, or replacing it, users can generate the output
          of their choice.  To do so, they are advised to study the grammar
          in HTMLDumper.pm.  Pay particular attention to the methods called
          through $actions.
        - Corrected output so that tables of hash values have <tr></tr>
          tag pairs as they should.
        - Adjusted the grammar to allow for calls to Dumper with multiple
          references.
        - Added a mechanism for controlling Sortkeys, Maxdepth, and Varname.
        - Added an object oriented calling sequence like Data::Dumper uses.
          The immediate affect is to allow you to call Dump with lists of
          references and their names.
        - Corrected grammar so hash keys can have special chars.  Previously
          they had to be valid Perl identifiers, which was obviously wrong.

        - Modified the grammar to:
            include undef as a valid value.
            allow for empty arrays and hashes
            allow hash key names to begin with a numeric
            allow key names to include '.'
          Thanks again to Dennis Sutch for pointing out these errors.

0.04  Mon Aug 30 15:26:18 Central African Time 2004
        - Changed from a brain dead regex scheme to use Parse::RecDescent.
          This probably introduced some errors, since the grammar may now
          fail.  But in the long run it should pay dividends.  Please
          send bug reports.
        - Added blessed objects to the new grammar so they no longer break
          the appearance of the table.  The contents of the object are shown
          in one column of a table, the other columns says isa Type where
          Type is the name of the class the reference is blessed into.
        - Added an examples directory.
        - Corrected the handling of embedded single quotes within the
          single quoted strings Data::Dumper produces.

0.03  Sat Aug 28 12:36:55 Central African Time 2004
        - Applied patch of Dennis Sutch which converts special characters
          into html recognized symbols (& -> &amp; etc)

0.02  Wed Oct  8 08:09:51 CDT 2003
        - Added Test::More to the prerequisite list in Makefile.PL.
        - Corrected tests so they no longer rely on the order of hash
          keys.
