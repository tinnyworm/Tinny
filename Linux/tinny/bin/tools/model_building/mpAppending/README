This template directory is for FP/RF Merchant Profile Appending.

1. Link auths.dat.gz in 00_dataIn.
2. Link MPB-2.0 files in MP_DIR.
    The naming conventions for MPB 2.0 are
         MPB-2.0-${week90_5_digit}-${calc_date}-MERRISK-ASCII-001.gz
         MPB-2.0-${week90_5_digit}-${calc_date}-MERRISK-ASCII-002.gz
         ........
         MPB-2.0-${week90_5_digit}-${calc_date}-MERRISK-ASCII-GLOBDEF
         MPB-2.0-${week90_5_digit}-${calc_date}-MERRISK-ASCII-SUMMARY

         NOTE: The week90 is the week on which the MP was build.

3. Create MCC-CNTRY default file in MP_DIR
    under bash run
      for i in *-SUMMARY;
      do
         b=`basename $i | sed -e 's/-SUMMARY//'`;
         zcat $b-00?.gz | colgrep 5 MCNTRY= | gzip -c > $b-MCCD.gz;
      done

3. Modify Makefile.
    You may change the following variables:
    DELAY:       The week90 MP appended is int((Transaction_date-DELAY)/7).
                 For regular FP models, it should be 17
    FIRST_WEEK:  Week90 of the first MP used for appending.
                 Example:
                   > 2day90 20021001|awk '{print int(($6-17)/7)}'
                 note: 17 is the DELAY
    LAST_WEEK:   Week90 of the last MP used for appending.
    APP_PL:      Command line used for appending. 
                 Run ${TOOLS}/mp_app -h for help.

4. Run
      make >& make.out&

5. Check
      check make.out for errors
      make.out also show the hit rate for appending
      error log for each individual week is under errsOut
6. Final results
      under mergeSplit, 8 appended files, which are the auths file for eval
